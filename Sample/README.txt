IniConfigurator usage
====================================================

.Net core 3.0 preview doesn't support single exe release,
that's why we created the CMD file so we keep hidden the
long list of files.

We simply add the files IniConfigurator.cmd, configurator.ini 
and the IniConfigurator folder to our project and add the specific
parameters we want to configure in the configurator.ini file.
